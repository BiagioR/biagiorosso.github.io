## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Student at the University of Cambridge, working in macroeconomics, monetary economics, and development. My main interest and work is in theoretical DSGE and HANK modelling, the estimation of DSGE and HANK models with business cycle and empirical data and particularly Bayesian approaches, computational and solution methods in the state and sequence-space, institutional and behavioural frictions in DSGE, the role of wealth inequality and redistribution in the business cycle, the role of financial intermediares in macroeconomic transmission, and applications to the analysis of monetary and fiscal policy transmission and their optimal design.

After recently completing my Ph.D. internship at the Bank of England, I am joining the econ job market this fall (2025). I am particularly interested in research roles in Academia and Central Banking in any of the above areas. I would be happy to discuss any such opportunities. 

Below you will find a selection of my research output and ongoing work: please reach out if you would like the slides or a full draft of the listed works if this is signalled as available on request. To complement this, I also provided links to examples of materials I prepared for economics teaching on an array of courses in Cambridge (any errors are my own). At the bottom of the page, you can finally the handles for the social media on which I am active.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
